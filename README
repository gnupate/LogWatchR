This is sample code for a legacy rewrite.  The code itself is licensed under the GPL (V2 or any later version at the users discretion).  While the code is intended for production use (and is currently in production), I make no warranty, written or implied, that it won't destroy any system within 5 feet of the one it's installed and running on.

The code, and various versions of it, will be used as examples in a writing project I'm working on.
