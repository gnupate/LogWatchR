Here's a list of logwatcher projects that could be taken on by
anyone interested.  If you're going to work on something, let
me (Pat) know and I'll mark it in this file.  I'm happy to help
out while you work on things.  I'd like to do a code review
before you check in changes.

Easy stuff:
* add a good_patterns counter (2.4)
* add specific patterns counter (2.4)
* version catalogs (2.4)
* add a notifier for Russel's alert/notification system (Unplanned)
* build logfile handling tools (Unplanned)

Not too hard stuff:
* extract a Notifier Class w/tests
* extract DB handling to a class
* version DB schema (2.4)
* add a graphite notifier (2.4)

Harder stuff:
* add 'on the fly' tuning into the application. (After pattern counters)

Things to think about:
* make multithreaded (Unplanned)
* move to families of alerts? (Unplanned)
* make the patterns catalogs runnable ruby instead of YAML (can add
  hook methods to a pattern (e.g., to log a good pattern, or to check a
  dependency)
* create a separate DB (or table in a DB) for each kind of event


-------------

Done
* write unknown_log scanner
* add a shell script to build rpms
* fix alert thresholds
* build a DB weeder to clean out old events (after moved to SQLite
  model) 
* add unit/functional tests
* pull event memory out of object space and put it into a SQLite DB
* refactor based on reek
* add tests for Pattern class (not really needed since it's
  so simple, but it would be nice)
* build a catalog profiling tool
* rotated logs
* reread catalogs on the fly
* extract an event methods to Pattern Class
* daemonify logwatcher
* clean up SQLException error when the db table doesn't exist
* add testing switch to cut out the outer loop of the
  log reader
* added switches to allow cmdline override good and bad catalogs &
  log source
* make the mail notifier more useful (short subject line, 
  more info in body)
* build init.d start/stop scripts (2.2 - Spencer)
* build .spec file to package as an rpm (2.2 - Spencer)


Skipping
* add a host_not_seen_recently check (after moved to SQLite)
* stop worrying about the hosts file.
